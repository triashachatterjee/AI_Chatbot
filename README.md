Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered chatbot that assists in symptom analysis by utilizing OpenAI's GPT model. The chatbot interacts with users to gather symptom data and provides possible diagnoses or suggestions based on the symptoms input.

Features
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilizes OpenAIâ€™s GPT model for generating conversational responses based on user input.

Symptom-Disease Mapping: Custom JSON database mapping symptoms to related conditions for accurate symptom analysis.

Modular Codebase: The codebase is modular and scalable, allowing easy expansion and integration with other systems.

Quick Deployment: Built using Python, OpenAI API, and JSON for fast prototyping and deployment.

Fine-Tuning: Optionally fine-tuned with synthetic doctor-patient conversations to improve accuracy in medical queries.

Requirements
Python 3.12 or higher

OpenAI API Key (sign up at OpenAI)

Required Python Libraries:

openai

pandas

dotenv

json

Install dependencies using the following command:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-symptom-chatbot.git
cd ai-symptom-chatbot
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your OpenAI API key:

Create a .env file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:

ini
Copy
Edit
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Run the chatbot:

bash
Copy
Edit
python chatbot.py
Usage
The chatbot prompts the user to input symptoms.

Based on the symptoms, it provides possible diagnoses, severity levels, and medical advice.

The chatbot can handle typical symptom queries and is designed to help users with preliminary diagnosis.

Testing
To run the tests:

bash
Copy
Edit
pytest
Future Work
UI/UX Integration: Implement a web or mobile interface for user-friendly interactions.

Expanded Database: Integrate a larger, clinically curated dataset for improved accuracy.

Advanced NLP: Incorporate better NLP handling for ambiguous symptoms.
